## About
Practicing project, key goals:
* Research AWS services
* Research WebRTC
* Create a Web-Server application that uses those

### Tech:
Using technologies that I am already familiar with:
* ReactJS
* Java + Spring Framework

And partially new ones:
* Reactive Spring
* Semantic UI instead of Bootstrapp
* S3 storage to store screen recordings
* AWS Cloudfront to provide signed urls so that users could download videos directrly from AWS without us as a proxy
* Basic github action workflow
